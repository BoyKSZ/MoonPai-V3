# MoonPai-V3
Moonpai App for ADET and IMAN Finals Project

This is a group project however the programming / source code was done soley by me while the other members worked on the assets, presentation, flowchart, and other things.

MoonPai is a mobile app that features the character backgrounds of characters from the game Genshin Impact. It is a simple app made with Flutter but the challenge for this finals project is integrating a database system that was taught in the IMAN course into the app. The database houses assets like login info and data, it is done via XAAMP to simulate a local database in the system that will be accessed by the app. 

I managed to figure out how to link the MySQL database to the MoonPai app as it was running / demoing by using HTML and SQL coding to mix into the Dart/Flutter source of the App itself. The constraint however is that the database has to exist using XAAMP in a local system meaning the project did accomplish the challenge requirement but once exported the database system will not function.
